3. The verses got broken up! Put them back together

First halves:

Then a hurricane came, and
Our man saw his future drip,
Put a pencil to his temple,
And he wrote his first refrain,
Well, the word got around,
Took up a collection just to
“Get your education, don’t
The world's gonna know your name.

Second halves:

devastation reigned
dripping down the drain
connected it to his brain
a testament to his pain
they said, “This kid is insane, man”
send him to the mainland
forget from whence you came, and
What’s your name, man?”
