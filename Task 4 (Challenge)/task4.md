# Task 4 (Challenge)

## List of World Countries
Go to [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries) in a web browser. Select the list of countries and copy them to your clipboard. Open the file **task4.csv** and paste the contents of your clipboard into the file.

Your task is to use what you learned previously to re-format the text so that each country is on its own line. When you are done, you should be able to open **task4.csv** in Excel and have one column with all of the countries.

Open **task4_solution.csv** in VS Code for an example of the format you are aiming for.

Don't be afraid to undo your steps or start over if your approach isn't working. Good luck!
